# AI-Powered-Attrition-Prediction-System
# 🤖 AI-Powered Attrition Prediction System

A complete mini-project that uses machine learning to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company), built as part of an AI internship technical task.

## 🎯 Objective

- Clean and preprocess real-world HR data
- Build and evaluate classification models
- Visualize key insights and metrics
- Explore a trending AI topic (RAG)

## 📂 Dataset

**IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset**  
Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

## 📊 Project Structure

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values and categorical encoding
- Used `StandardScaler` for feature scaling
- Performed EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Visualized:
  - Attrition vs Age
  - Department-wise Attrition
  - Monthly Income by Job Role

### 2️⃣ Model Building

- Used **Random Forest Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning
- Train-test split with 80/20 ratio
- Metrics used:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Confusion matrix & ROC curve included

**Model Accuracy:** ~87%

### 3️⃣ Research Brief (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

PDF Summary included:  
- 🔍 What is RAG?  
- 💡 Why it matters?  
- 🧪 Real-world Use Case  
- ⚠️ Challenges
